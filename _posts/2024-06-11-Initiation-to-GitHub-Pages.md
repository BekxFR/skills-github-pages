I recently discovered the [GitHub courses page](https://github.com/skills), and today I tried GitHub Pages.

This course helps you create a site or blog from your GitHub repositories using GitHub Pages.

You can follow to cours on this [page](https://github.com/skills/github-pages).  
In the description of this course, you will learn about the possibilities of hosting project blogs, documentation, resumes, portfolios, or other static content.
Your GitHub repository can easily become your own website.  

For this repository and this course, I followed the instructions. I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the Minima theme.

I hope this blog post helps someone find the GitHub courses page. The content is very interesting, and the courses use bots to validate the steps if the tasks are well done. I think developers of all levels can learn something from these courses.
